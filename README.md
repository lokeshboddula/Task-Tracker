# Task Tracker Project

Hello and welcome! This project marks an exciting milestone in my Python learning journey.

## Overview

This is a simple yet functional task manager application built using Python. You can use it to keep track of your tasks and stay organized. It's designed to be easy to use, helping you manage your to-do list efficiently.

## Steps to Run the Project

Follow these steps to get the task manager up and running:

1. **Install Python**  
   If you don't have Python installed on your system, [download it from the official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it.

2. **Download the Project Files**  
   Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. **Run the Application**  
   Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the `task-manager.py` file is located, and run the following command:
   ```bash
   python task-manager.py
   ```

4. **Start Managing Your Tasks**  
   Once the script runs, you can start adding, viewing, and managing your tasks in the task manager.

## Features
